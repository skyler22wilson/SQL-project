--**Question 1: Which cities and countries have the highest level of transaction revenues on the site?**


--SQL Queries:

--Elected to filter out columns where the city was = country since it was NULL prior and when the revenues werent 0 to provide a better picture of the data

SELECT city, country, SUM(total_transaction_revenue) total_revenue,
RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(total_transaction_revenue) DESC )
FROM all_sessions
WHERE city != country
GROUP BY city, country
HAVING SUM(total_transaction_revenue) > 0
LIMIT 10;

--Answer: from the query below you can see that San Francisco has the highest transaction value

| "city"          | "country"       | "total_revenue" | "rank" |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| "San Francisco" | "United States" | "15643.20"      | "1"    |
| "Sunnyvale"     | "United States" | "9922.30"       | "2"    |
| "Atlanta"       | "United States" | "8544.40"       | "3"    |
| "Palo Alto"     | "United States" | "6080.00"       | "4"    |
| "Tel Aviv-Yafo" | "Israel"        | "6020.00"       | "5"    |
| "New York"      | "United States" | "5303.60"       | "6"    |
| "Mountain View" | "United States" | "4833.60"       | "7"    |
| "Los Angeles"   | "United States" | "4794.80"       | "8"    |
| "Chicago"       | "United States" | "4495.20"       | "9"    |
| "Sydney"        | "Australia"     | "3580.00"       | "10"   |

--**Question 2: What is the average number of products ordered from visitors in each city and country?**


--SQL Queries: 

--Average per city and country
SELECT a.country, a.city, ROUND(AVG(pd.product_quantity), 2) AS avg_quantity 
FROM all_sessions a
JOIN product_details pd ON pd.unique_id = a.unique_id
GROUP BY a.country, a.city
ORDER BY avg_quantity DESC

--Answer: Bouler has the highest average quantity ordered on the site


| "country"       | "city"        | "avg_quantity" |
|-----------------|---------------|----------------|
| "United States" | "Boulder"     | "6.25"         |
| "Mexico"        | "Mexico"      | "0.96"         |
| "United States" | "Las Vegas"   | "0.33"         |
| "Philippines"   | "Makati"      | "0.33"         |
| "United States" | "San Mateo"   | "0.33"         |
| "Canada"        | "Quebec City" | "0.14"         |
| "China"         | "China"       | "0.12"         |
| "Russia"        | "Moscow"      | "0.11"         |
| "United States" | "Cupertino"   | "0.08"         |
| "Hungary"       | "Hungary"     | "0.04"         |

--**Question 3: Is there any pattern in the types (product categories) of products ordered from visitors in each city and country?**


--SQL Queries:

SELECT subq.city, subq.country, subq.product_category, subq.quantity_count
--subquery to only select city, country and category where a transaction occured
FROM (
	SELECT a.city, a.country, pd.product_category,
	COUNT(pd.product_quantity) AS quantity_count, pd.product_quantity
	FROM all_sessions a
	JOIN product_details pd ON a.unique_id = pd.unique_id
	-- filtered out cities where they were NULL because the data provided was not really informative
    WHERE pd.product_quantity > 0 AND a.city != a.country AND pd.product_category IS NOT NULL
	GROUP BY a.country, a.city, pd.product_category, pd.product_quantity
	ORDER BY a.country 
) AS subq
